# senior-project-compiler
This is my senior project, I plan on creating a simple conpiler that will later be used to write another compiler. 

This is a very ambitious project that I started in December of 2023 over winter break of my junior year of university at NMU (Northern Michigan University). I completed the first version of the lexer in about a month with research factored in, and I haven't been able to work on much more up to now, Feb 16. due to a large course load. I hope to be able to expand this project little by little as the semester goes on.
